# Trust Registry

## Overview
A trust registry enables providers build ecosystems where all participants can know which issuers are part of that ecosystem. 
An open source spec, a Trust Registry gives providers a way to express which issuers they have onboarded. 
Governance allows verifiers to add their ecosystem provider to their wallet and only approve credentials that have been issued by issuers trusted from a governance provider. 

### A scenario
As a provider
- Add Framework
- Register Issuer 
- Register Verifier

As holder:
